Authlete is an <strong>API-first service</strong>\n      where every aspect of the platform is configurable via API. This explorer provides a convenient way to\n      authenticate and interact with the API, allowing you to see Authlete in action quickly. 🚀\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      At a high level, the Authlete API is grouped into two categories:\n    </p>\n    <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\">\n      <li><strong>Management APIs</strong>: Enable you to manage services and clients. 🔧</li>\n      <li><strong>Runtime APIs</strong>: Allow you to build your own Authorization Servers or Verifiable Credential (VC)\n        issuers. 🔐</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>All API endpoints are secured using access tokens issued by Authlete's Identity Provider (IdP). If you already\n      have an Authlete account, simply use the <em>Get Token</em> option on the Authentication page to log in and obtain\n      an access token for API usage. If you don't have an account yet, <a href=\"https://console.authlete.com/register\">sign up\n        here</a> to get started.</p>\n  </header>\n  <main>\n    <section id=\"api-servers\" class=\"mb-10\">\n      <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mb-4\">🌐 API Servers</h2>\n      <p>Authlete is a global service with clusters available in multiple regions across the world.</p>\n      <p>Currently, our service is available in the following regions:</p>\n      <div class=\"grid grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\n        <div class=\"p-4 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow\">\n          <p class=\"text-center font-semibold\">🇺🇸 US</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"p-4 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow\">\n          <p class=\"text-center font-semibold\">🇯🇵 JP</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"p-4 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow\">\n          <p class=\"text-center font-semibold\">🇪🇺 EU</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"p-4 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow\">\n          <p class=\"text-center font-semibold\">🇧🇷 Brazil</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <p>Our customers can host their data in the region that best meets their requirements.</p>\n      <a href=\"#servers\" class=\"block mt-4 text-green-500 dark:text-green-300 hover:underline text-center\">Select your\n        preferred server</a>\n    </section>\n    <section id=\"authentication\" class=\"mb-10\">\n      <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mb-4\">🔑 Authentication</h2>\n      <p>The API Explorer requires an access token to call the API.</p>\n      <p>You can create the access token from the <a href=\"https://console.authlete.com\">Authlete Management Console</a> and set it in the HTTP Bearer section of Authentication page.</p>\n      <p>Alternatively, if you have an Authlete account, the API Explorer can log you in with your Authlete account and\n        automatically acquire the required access token.</p>\n      <div class=\"theme-admonition theme-admonition-warning admonition_o5H7 alert alert--warning\">\n        <div class=\"admonitionContent_Knsx\">\n          <p>⚠️ <strong>Important Note:</strong> When the API Explorer acquires the token after login, the access tokens\n            will have the same permissions as the user who logs in as part of this flow.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <a href=\"#auth\" class=\"block mt-4 text-green-500 dark:text-green-300 hover:underline text-center\">Setup your\n        access token</a>\n    </section>\n    <section id=\"tutorials\" class=\"mb-10\">\n      <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mb-4\">🎓 Tutorials</h2>\n      <p>If you have successfully tested the API from the API Console and want to take the next step of integrating the\n        API into your application, or if you want to see a sample using Authlete APIs, follow the links below.

        "description": "This API parses request parameters of an authorization request and returns necessary data for the authorization server\nimplementation to process the authorization request further.\n\n<br>\n<details>\n<summary>Description</summary>\n\nThis API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the authorization endpoint of\nthe service. The endpoint implementation must extract the request parameters from the authorization\nrequest from the client application and pass them as the value of parameters request parameter for\nAuthlete's `/auth/authorization` API.\n\nThe value of `parameters` is either (1) the entire query string when the HTTP method of the request\nfrom the client application is `GET` or (2) the entire entity body (which is formatted in\n`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`) when the HTTP method of the request from the client application\nis `POST`.\n\nThe following code snippet is an example in JAX-RS showing how to extract request parameters from\nthe authorization request.\n\n```java\n@GET\npublic Response get(@Context UriInfo uriInfo)\n{\n    // The query parameters of the authorization request.\n    String parameters = uriInfo.getRequestUri().getQuery();\n    ......\n}\n\n@POST\n@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED)\npublic Response post(String parameters)\n{\n    // 'parameters' is the entity body of the authorization request.\n    ......\n}\n```\n\nThe endpoint implementation does not have to parse the request parameters from the client application\nbecause Authlete's `/auth/authorization` API does it.\n\nThe response from `/auth/authorization` API has various parameters. Among them, it is `action`\nparameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the\nnext action that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of\n`action`, the service implementation must take the steps described below.\n\n**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization\nserver implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.\nIn either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.\nTherefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with\nHTTP status of \"500 Internal Server Error\". Authlete recommends `application/json` as the content\ntype although OAuth 2.0 specification does not mention the format of the error response when the\nredirect URI is not usable.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as\nthe entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\nThe endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client application\nsince \"500 Internal Server Error\" is not required by OAuth 2.0.\n\n**BAD_REQUEST**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application\nis invalid.\n\nA response with HTTP status of \"400 Bad Request\" should be returned to the client application and\nAuthlete recommends `application/json` as the content type although OAuth 2.0 specification does\nnot mention the format of the error response when the redirect URI is not usable.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as\nthe entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\nThe endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client application since\n\"400 Bad Request\" is not required by OAuth 2.0.\n\n**LOCATION**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `LOCATION`, it means that the request from the client application\nis invalid but the redirect URI\nto which the error should be reported has been determined.\n\nA response with HTTP status of \"302 Found\" must be returned to the client application with `Location`\nheader which has a redirect URI with error parameter.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a redirect URI with `error` parameter, so it can be used as the\nvalue of `Location` header.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation must generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nLocation: {responseContent}\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n```\n\n**FORM**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `FORM`, it means that the request from the client application is\ninvalid but the redirect URI to which the error should be reported has been determined, and that\nthe authorization request contains `response_mode=form_post` as is defined in [OAuth 2.0 Form Post\nResponse Mode](https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-form-post-response-mode-1_0.html).\n\nThe HTTP status of the response returned to the client application should be \"200 OK\" and the\ncontent type should be `text/html;charset=UTF-8`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is an HTML which can be used as the entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation must generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n**NO_INTERACTION**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `NO_INTERACTION`, it means that the request from the client application\nhas no problem and requires the service to process the request without displaying any user interface\npages for authentication or consent. This case happens when the authorization request contains\n`prompt=none`.\n\nThe service must follow the steps described below.\n\n[1] END-USER AUTHENTICATION\n\nCheck whether an end-user has already logged in. If an end-user has logged in, go to the next step ([MAX_AGE]).\nOtherwise, call Authlete's `/auth/authorization/fail` API with `reason=NOT_LOGGED_IN` and use the response from\nthe API to generate a response to the client application.\n\n[2] MAX AGE\n\nGet the value of `maxAge` parameter from the `/auth/authorization` API response. The value represents\nthe maximum authentication age which has come from `max_age` request parameter or `defaultMaxAge`\nconfiguration parameter of the client application. If the value is `0`, go to the next step ([SUBJECT]).\nOtherwise, follow the sub steps described below.\n\n(i) Get the time at which the end-user was authenticated. that this value is not managed by Authlete,\nmeaning that it is expected that the service implementation manages the value. If the service implementation\ndoes not manage authentication time of end-users, call Authlete's `/auth/authorization/fail` API\nwith `reason=MAX_AGE_NOT_SUPPORTED` and use the API response to generate a response to the client\napplication.\n\n(ii) Add the value of the maximum authentication age (which is represented in seconds) to the authentication\ntime. The calculated value is the expiration time.\n\n(iii) Check whether the calculated value is equal to or greater than the current time. If this condition\nis satisfied, go to the next step ([SUBJECT]). Otherwise, call Authlete's `/auth/authorization/fail`\nAPI with `reason=EXCEEDS_MAX_AGE` and use the API response to generate a response to the client\napplication.\n\n[3] SUBJECT\n\nGet the value of `subject` from the `/auth/authorization` API response. The value represents an\nend-user who the client application expects to grant authorization. If the value is `null`, go to\nthe next step ([ACRs]). Otherwise, follow the sub steps described below.\n\n(i) Compare the value of the requested subject to the current end-user.\n\n(ii) If they are equal, go to the next step ([ACRs]). If they are not equal, call Authlete's\n`/auth/authorization/fail` API with `reason=DIFFERENT_SUBJECT` and use the response from the API\nto generate a response to the client application.\n\n[4] ACRs\n\nGet the value of `acrs` from the `/auth/authorization` API response. The value represents a list\nof ACRs (Authentication Context Class References) and comes from (1) acr claim in `claims` request\nparameter, (2) `acr_values` request parameter, or (3) `default_acr_values` configuration parameter\nof the client application.\n\nIt is ensured that all the ACRs in acrs are supported by the authorization server implementation.\nIn other words, it is ensured that all the ACRs are listed in `acr_values_supported` configuration\nparameter of the authorization server.\n\nIf the value of ACRs is `null`, go to the next step ([ISSUE]). Otherwise, follow the sub steps\ndescribed below.\n\n(i) Get the ACR performed for the authentication of the current end-user. Note that this value is\nmanaged not by Authlete but by the authorization server implementation. (If the authorization server\nimplementation cannot handle ACRs, it should not have listed ACRs as `acr_values_supported`.)\n\n(ii) Compare the ACR value obtained in the above step to each element in the ACR array (`acrs`)\nin the listed order.\n\n(iii) If the ACR value was found in the array, (= the ACR performed for the authentication of the\ncurrent end-user did not match any one of the ACRs requested by the client application), check\nwhether one of the requested ACRs must be satisfied or not using `acrEssential` parameter in the\n`/auth/authorization` API response. If the value of `acrEssential` parameter is `true`, call Authlete's\n`/auth/authorization/fail` API with `reason=ACR_NOT_SATISFIED` and use the response from the API\nto generate a response to the client application. Otherwise, go to the next step ([SCOPES]).\n\n[5] SCOPES\n\nGet the value of `scopes` from the `/auth/authorization` API response. If the array contains a\nscope which has not been granted to the client application by the end-user in the past, call\nAuthlete's `/auth/authorization/fail` API with `reason=CONSENT_REQUIRED` and use the response from\nthe API to generate a response to the client application. Otherwise, go to the next step ([RESOURCES]).\n\nNote that Authlete provides APIs to manage records of granted scopes (`/api/client/granted_scopes/*`\nAPIs), which is only available in a dedicated/onpremise Authlete server (contact sales@authlete.com\nfor details).\n\n[6] DYNAMIC SCOPES\n\nGet the value of `dynamicScopes` from the `/auth/authorization` API response. If the array contains\na scope which has not been granted to the client application by the end-user in the past, call\nAuthlete's `/auth/authorization/fail` API with `reason=CONSENT_REQUIRED` and use the response from\nthe API to generate a response to the client application. Otherwise, go to the next step ([RESOURCES]).\n\nNote that Authlete provides APIs to manage records of granted scopes (`/api/client/granted_scopes/*`\nAPIs) but dynamic scopes are not remembered as granted scopes.\n\n[7] RESOURCES\n\nGet the value of `resources` from the `/auth/authorization` API response. The array represents\nthe values of the `resource` request parameters. If you want to reject the request, call Authlete's\n`/auth/authorization/fail` API with `reason=INVALID_TARGET` and use the response from the API to\ngenerate a response to the client application. Otherwise, go to the next step ([ISSUE]).\n\nSee \"Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0\" for details.\n\n[8] ISSUE\n\nIf all the above steps succeeded, the last step is to issue an authorization code, an ID token\nand/or an access token. (There is a special case, though. In the case of `response_type=none`,\nnothing is issued.) It can be performed by calling Authlete's `/auth/authorization/issue` API.\nThe API requires the following parameters. Prepare these parameters and call `/auth/authorization/issue`\nAPI and use the response to generate a response to the client application.\n\n- <u>`ticket` (required)</u><br>\n  This parameter represents a ticket which is exchanged with tokens at `/auth/authorization/issue`.\n  Use the value of `ticket` contained in the `/auth/authorization` API response.\n\n- <u>`subject` (required)</u><br>\n  This parameter represents the unique identifier of the current end-user. It is often called \"user ID\"\n  and it may or may not be visible to the user. In any case, it is a number or a string assigned\n  to an end-user by the authorization server implementation. Authlete does not care about the format\n  of the value of subject, but it must consist of only ASCII letters and its length must not exceed 100.\n\n  When the value of `subject` parameter in the /auth/authorization API response is not `null`,\n  it is necessarily identical to the value of `subject` parameter in the `/auth/authorization/issue`\n  API request.\n\n  The value of this parameter will be embedded in an ID token as the value of `sub` claim. When\n  the value of `subject_type` configuration parameter of the client application is `PAIRWISE`,\n  the value of sub claim is different from the value specified by this parameter, See [8. Subject\n  Identifier Types](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes) of OpenID\n  Connect Core 1.0 for details about subject types.\n\n  You can use the `sub` request parameter to adjust the value of the `sub` claim in an ID token.\n  See the description of the `sub` request parameter for details.\n\n- <u>`authTime` (optional)</u><br>\n  This parameter represents the time when the end-user authentication occurred. Its value is the\n  number of seconds from `1970-01-01`. The value of this parameter will be embedded in an ID token\n  as the value of `auth_time` claim.\n\n- <u>`acr` (optional)</u><br>\n  This parameter represents the ACR (Authentication Context Class Reference) which the authentication\n  of the end-user satisfies. When `acrs` in the `/auth/authorization` API response is a non-empty\n  array and the value of `acrEssential` is `true`, the value of this parameter must be one of the\n  array elements. Otherwise, even `null` is allowed. The value of this parameter will be embedded\n  in an ID token as the value of `acr` claim.\n\n- <u>`claims` (optional)</u><br>\n  This parameter represents claims of the end-user. \"Claims\" here are pieces of information about\n  the end-user such as `\"name\"`, `\"email\"` and `\"birthdate\"`. The authorization server implementation\n  is required to gather claims of the end-user, format the claim values into JSON and set the JSON\n  string as the value of this parameter.\n\n  The claims which the authorization server implementation is required to gather are listed in\n  `claims` parameter in the `/auth/authorization` API response.\n\n  For example, if claims parameter lists `\"name\"`, `\"email\"` and `\"birthdate\"`, the value of this\n  parameter should look like the following.\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"name\": \"John Smith\",\n    \"email\": \"john@example.com\",\n    \"birthdate\": \"1974-05-06\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n  `claimsLocales` parameter in the `/auth/authorization` API response lists the end-user's preferred\n  languages and scripts, ordered by preference. When `claimsLocales` parameter is a non-empty array,\n  its elements should be taken into account when the authorization server implementation gathers\n  claim values. Especially, note the excerpt below from [5.2. Claims Languages and Scripts](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimsLanguagesAndScripts)\n  of OpenID Connect Core 1.0.\n\n  > When the OP determines, either through the `claims_locales` parameter, or by other means, that\n  the End-User and Client are requesting Claims in only one set of languages and scripts, it is\n  RECOMMENDED that OPs return Claims without language tags when they employ this language and script.\n  It is also RECOMMENDED that Clients be written in a manner that they can handle and utilize Claims\n  using language tags.\n\n  If `claims` parameter in the `/auth/authorization` API response is `null` or an empty array,\n  the value of this parameter should be `null`.\n\n  See [5.1. Standard Claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims)\n  of OpenID Connect core 1.0 for claim names and their value formats. Note (1) that the authorization\n  server implementation support its special claims ([5.1.2. Additional Claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AdditionalClaims))\n  and (2) that claim names may be followed by a language tag ([5.2. Claims Languages and Scripts](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimsLanguagesAndScripts)).\n  Read the specification of [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)\n  for details.\n\n  The claim values in this parameter will be embedded in an ID token.\n\n  Note that `idTokenClaims` parameter is available in the `/auth/authorization` API response.\n  The parameter has the value of the `\"id_token\"` property in the `claims` request parameter or\n  in the `\"claims\"` property in a request object. The value of this parameter should be considered\n  when you prepare claim values.\n\n- <u>`properties` (optional)</u><br>\n  Extra properties to associate with an access token and/or an authorization code that may be issued\n  by this request. Note that `properties` parameter is accepted only when `Content-Type` of the\n  request is `application/json`, so don't use `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for details.\n\n- <u>`scopes` (optional)</u><br>\n  Scopes to associate with an access token and/or an authorization code. If this parameter is `null`,\n  the scopes specified in the original authorization request from the client application are used.\n  In other cases, including the case of an empty array, the specified scopes will replace the original\n  scopes contained in the original authorization request.\n\n  Even scopes that are not included in the original authorization request can be specified. However,\n  as an exception, `openid` scope is ignored on the server side if it is not included in the original\n  request. It is because the existence of `openid` scope considerably changes the validation steps\n  and because adding `openid` triggers generation of an ID token (although the client application\n  has not requested it) and the behavior is a major violation against the specification.\n\n  If you add `offline_access` scope although it is not included in the original request, keep in\n  mind that the specification requires explicit consent from the user for the scope ([OpenID Connect\n  Core 1.0, 11. Offline Access](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#OfflineAccess)).\n  When `offline_access` is included in the original request, the current implementation of Authlete's\n  `/auth/authorization` API checks whether the request has come along with `prompt` request parameter\n  and the value includes consent. However, note that the implementation of Authlete's `/auth/authorization/issue`\n  API does not perform such checking if `offline_access` scope is added via this `scopes` parameter.\n\n- <u>`sub` (optional)</u><br>\n  The value of the `sub` claim in an ID token. If the value of this request parameter is not empty,\n  it is used as the value of the `sub` claim. Otherwise, the value of the `subject` request parameter\n  is used as the value of the `sub` claim. The main purpose of this parameter is to hide the actual\n  value of the subject from client applications.\n\n  Note that even if this `sub` parameter is not empty, the value of the subject request parameter\n  is used as the value of the subject which is associated with the access token.\n\n**INTERACTION**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INTERACTION`, it means that the request from the client application\nhas no problem and requires the service to process the request with user interaction by an HTML form.\nThe purpose of the UI displayed to the end-user is to ask the end-user to grant authorization to\nthe client application. The items described below are some points which the service implementation\nshould take into account when it builds the UI.\n\n[1] DISPLAY MODE\n\nThe response from `/auth/authorization` API has `display` parameter. It is one of `PAGE` (default),\n`POPUP`, `TOUCH` and `WAP` The meanings of the values are described in [3.1.2.1. Authentication\nRequest of OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest).\nBasically, the authorization server implementation should display the UI which is suitable for the\ndisplay mode, but it is okay for the authorization server implementation to \"attempt to detect the\ncapabilities of the User Agent and present an appropriate display\".\n\nIt is ensured that the value of `display` is one of the supported display modes which are specified\nby `supportedDisplays` configuration parameter of the service.\n\n[2] UI LOCALE\n\nThe response from `/auth/authorization` API has `uiLocales` parameter. It it is not `null`, it lists\nlanguage tag values (such as `fr-CA`, `ja-JP` and `en`) ordered by preference. The service implementation\nshould display the UI in one of the language listed in the parameter when possible. It is ensured\nthat language tags listed in `uiLocales` are contained in the list of supported UI locales which\nare specified by `supportedUiLocales` configuration parameter of the service.\n\n[3] CLIENT INFORMATION\n\nThe authorization server implementation should show information about the client application to\nthe end-user. The information is embedded in `client` parameter in the response from `/auth/authorization`\nAPI.\n\n[4] SCOPES\n\nA client application requires authorization for specific permissions. In OAuth 2.0 specification,\n\"scope\" is a technical term which represents a permission. `scopes` parameter in the response\nfrom `/auth/authorization` API is a list of scopes requested by the client application. The service\nimplementation should show the end-user the scopes.\n\nThe authorization server implementation may choose not to show scopes to which the end-user has\ngiven consent in the past. To put it the other way around, the authorization server implementation\nmay show only the scopes to which the end-user has not given consent yet. However, if the value\nof `prompts` response parameter contains `CONSENT`, the authorization server implementation has\nto obtain explicit consent from the end-user even if the end-user has given consent to all the\nrequested scopes in the past.\n\nNote that Authlete provides APIs to manage records of granted scopes (`/api/client/granted_scopes/*`\nAPIs), but the APIs work only in the case the Authlete server you use is a dedicated Authlete server\n(contact sales@authlete.com for details). In other words, the APIs of the shared Authlete server\nare disabled intentionally (in order to prevent garbage data from being accumulated) and they\nreturn 403 Forbidden.\n\nIt is ensured that the values in `scopes` parameter are contained in the list of supported scopes\nwhich are specified by `supportedScopes` configuration parameter of the service.\n\n[5] DYNAMIC SCOPES\n\nThe authorization request may include dynamic scopes. The list of recognized dynamic scopes are\naccessible by getDynamicScopes() method. See the description of the [DynamicScope](https://authlete.github.io/authlete-java-common/com/authlete/common/dto/DynamicScope.html)\nclass for details about dynamic scopes.\n\n[6] AUTHORIZATION DETAILS\n\nThe authorization server implementation should show the end-user \"authorization details\" if the\nrequest includes it. The value of `authorization_details` parameter in the response is the content\nof the `authorization_details` request parameter.\n\nSee \"OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests\" for details.\n\n[7] PURPOSE\n\nThe authorization server implementation must show the value of the `purpose` request parameter if\nit supports [OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html).\nSee [8. Transaction-specific Purpose](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html#rfc.section.8)\nin the specification for details.\n\nNote that the value of `purpose` response parameter is the value of the purpose request parameter.\n\n[7] END-USER AUTHENTICATION\n\nNecessarily, the end-user must be authenticated (= must login the service) before granting authorization\nto the client application. Simply put, a login form is expected to be displayed for end-user authentication.\nThe service implementation must follow the steps described below to comply with OpenID Connect.\n(Or just always show a login form if it's too much of a bother.)\n\n(i) Get the value of `prompts` response parameter. It corresponds to the value of the `prompt`\nrequest parameter. Details of the request parameter are described in [3.1.2.1. Authentication\nRequest](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest) of OpenID Connect Core 1.0.\n\n(ii) If the value of `prompts` parameter is `SELECT_ACCOUNT` display a form to let the end-user\nselect on of his/her accounts for login. If `subject` response parameter is not `null`, it is the\nend-user ID that the client application expects, so the value should be used to determine the value\nof the login ID. Note that a subject and a login ID are not necessarily equal. If the value of\n`subject` response parameter is `null`, the value of `loginHint` response parameter should be referred\nto as a hint to determine the value of the login ID. The value of `loginHint` response parameter\nis simply the value of the `login_hint` request parameter.\n\n(iii) If the value of `prompts` response parameter contains `LOGIN`, display a form to urge the\nend-user to login even if the end-user has already logged in. If the value of `subject` response\nparameter is not `null`, it is the end-user ID that the client application expects, so the value\nshould be used to determine the value of the login ID. Note that a subject and a login ID are not\nnecessarily equal. If the value of `subject` response parameter is `null`, the value of `loginHint`\nresponse parameter should be referred to as a hint to determine the value of the login ID. The value\nof `loginHint` response parameter is simply the value of the `login_hint` request parameter.\n\n(iv) If the value of `prompts` response parameter does not contain `LOGIN`, the authorization server\nimplementation does not have to authenticate the end-user if all the conditions described below\nare satisfied. If any one of the conditions is not satisfied, show a login form to authenticate\nthe end-user.\n\n- An end-user has already logged in the service.\n\n- The login ID of the current end-user matches the value of `subject` response parameter.\nThis check is required only when the value of `subject` response parameter is a non-null value.\n\n- The max age, which is the number of seconds contained in `maxAge` response parameter,\nhas not passed since the current end-user logged in your service. This check is required only when\nthe value of `maxAge` response parameter is a non-zero value.\n\n- If the authorization server implementation does not manage authentication time of end-users\n(= if the authorization server implementation cannot know when end-users logged in) and if the\nvalue of `maxAge` response parameter is a non-zero value, a login form should be displayed.\n\n- The ACR (Authentication Context Class Reference) of the authentication performed for\nthe current end-user satisfies one of the ACRs listed in `acrs` response parameter. This check is\nrequired only when the value of `acrs` response parameter is a non-empty array.\n\nIn every case, the end-user authentication must satisfy one of the ACRs listed in `acrs` response\nparameter when the value of `acrs` response parameter is a non-empty array and `acrEssential`\nresponse parameter is `true`.\n\n[9] GRANT/DENY BUTTONS\n\nThe end-user is supposed to choose either (1) to grant authorization to the client application or\n(2) to deny the authorization request. The UI must have UI components to accept the judgment by\nthe user. Usually, a button to grant authorization and a button to deny the request are provided.\n\nWhen the value of `subject` response parameter is not `null`, the end-user authentication must be\nperformed for the subject, meaning that the authorization server implementation should repeatedly\nshow a login form until the subject is successfully authenticated.\n\nThe end-user will choose either (1) to grant authorization to the client application or (2) to\ndeny the authorization request. When the end-user chose to deny the authorization request, call\nAuthlete's `/auth/authorization/fail` API with `reason=DENIED` and use the response from the API\nto generate a response to the client application.\n\nWhen the end-user chose to grant authorization to the client application, the authorization server\nimplementation has to issue an authorization code, an ID token, and/or an access token to the client\napplication. (There is a special case. When `response_type=none`, nothing is issued.) Issuing the\ntokens can be performed by calling Authlete's `/auth/authorization/issue` API.

        "description": "This API parses request parameters of an authorization request and returns necessary data for the\nauthorization server implementation to process the authorization request further.\n\n<br>\n<details>\n<summary>Description</summary>\n\nThis API is supposed to be called from with the implementation of the token endpoint of the service.\nThe endpoint implementation must extract the request parameters from the token request from the\nclient application and pass them as the value of parameters request parameter to Authlete's `/auth/token` API.\nThe value of parameters is the entire entity body (which is formatted in `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`)\nof the token request.\n\nIn addition, if the token endpoint of the authorization server implementation supports basic authentication\nas a means of [client authentication](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-2.3),\nthe client credentials must be extracted from `Authorization` header and they must be passed as\n`clientId` request parameter and `clientSecret` request parameter to Authlete's `/auth/token` API.\n\nThe following code snippet is an example in JAX-RS showing how to extract request parameters from\nthe token request and client credentials from Authorization header.\n\n```java\n@POST\n@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED)\npublic Response post(\n        @HeaderParam(HttpHeaders.AUTHORIZATION) String auth,\n        String parameters)\n{\n    // Convert the value of Authorization header (credentials of\n    // the client application), if any, into BasicCredentials.\n    BasicCredentials credentials = BasicCredentials.parse(auth);\n\n    // The credentials of the client application extracted from\n    // 'Authorization' header. These may be null.\n    String clientId     = credentials == null ? null\n                        : credentials.getUserId();\n    String clientSecret = credentials == null ? null\n                        : credentials.getPassword();\n\n    // Process the given parameters.\n    return process(parameters, clientId, clientSecret);\n}\n```\n\nThe response from `/auth/token` API has some parameters. Among them, it is action parameter that\nthe service implementation should check first because it denotes the next action that the authorization\nserver implementation should take. According to the value of action, the authorization server\nimplementation must take the steps described below.\n\n**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization\nserver implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.\nIn either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.\nTherefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with\nHTTP status of \"500 Internal Server Error\". Authlete recommends `application/json` as the content\ntype although OAuth 2.0 specification does not mention the format of the error response when the\nredirect URI is not usable.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be\nused as the entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\nThe endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client application\nsince \"500 Internal Server Error\" is not required by OAuth 2.0.\n\n\n**INVALID_CLIENT**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INVALID_CLIENT`, it means that authentication of the client failed.\nIn this case, the HTTP status of the response to the client application is either \"400 Bad Request\"\nor \"401 Unauthorized\". This requirement comes from [RFC 6749, 5.2. Error Response](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-5.2).\nThe description about `invalid_client` shown below is an excerpt from RFC 6749.\n\nClient authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no client authentication included, or unsupported\nauthentication method). The authorization server MAY return an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code\nto indicate which HTTP authentication schemes are supported. If the client attempted to authenticate\nvia the `Authorization` request header field, the authorization server MUST respond with an HTTP\n401 (Unauthorized) status code and include the `WWW-Authenticate` response header field matching\nthe authentication scheme used by the client.\n\nIn either case, the value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which can be used as the entity\nbody of the response to the client application.\n\nThe following illustrate responses which the service implementation must generate and return to\nthe client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n<br>\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: {challenge}\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n**BAD_REQUEST**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application\nis invalid.\n\nA response with HTTP status of \"400 Bad Request\" must be returned to the client application and\nthe content type must be `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as\nthe entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n**PASSWORD**\n\nWhen the value of `\"action\"` is `\"PASSWORD\"`, it means that\nthe request from the client application is valid and `grant_type`\nis `\"password\"`. That is, the flow is\n<a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-4.3\">\"Resource Owner\nPassword Credentials\"</a>.\n\nIn this case, {@link #getUsername()} returns the value of `\"username\"`\nrequest parameter and {@link #getPassword()} returns the value of {@code\n\"password\"} request parameter which were contained in the token request\nfrom the client application. The service implementation must validate the\ncredentials of the resource owner (= end-user) and take either of the\nactions below according to the validation result.\n\n1. When the credentials are valid, call Authlete's /auth/token/issue} API to generate an access token for the client\n    application. The API requires `\"ticket\"` request parameter and\n    `\"subject\"` request parameter.\n    Use the value returned from {@link #getTicket()} method as the value\n    for `\"ticket\"` parameter.\n2. The response from `/auth/token/issue` API ({@link\n    TokenIssueResponse}) contains data (an access token and others)\n    which should be returned to the client application. Use the data\n    to generate a response to the client application.\n3. When the credentials are invalid</b>, call Authlete's {@code\n    /auth/token/fail} API with `reason=`{@link\n    TokenFailRequest.Reason#INVALID_RESOURCE_OWNER_CREDENTIALS\n    INVALID_RESOURCE_OWNER_CREDENTIALS} to generate an error response\n    for the client application. The API requires `\"ticket\"`\n    request parameter. Use the value returned from {@link #getTicket()}\n    method as the value for `\"ticket\"` parameter.\n4. The response from `/auth/token/fail` API ({@link\n    TokenFailResponse}) contains error information which should be\n    returned to the client application. Use it to generate a response\n    to the client application.\n\n**OK**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `OK`, it means that the request from the client application is valid\nand an access token, and optionally an ID token, is ready to be issued.\n\nThe HTTP status of the response returned to the client application must be \"200 OK\" and the content\ntype must be `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which contains an access token (and optionally\nan ID token), so it can be used as the entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation must generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n\n**TOKEN_EXCHANGE (Authlete 2.3 onwards)**\n\nWhen the value of `\"action\"` is `\"TOKEN_EXCHANGE\"`, it means\nthat the request from the client application is a valid token exchange\nrequest (cf. <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693.html\">RFC\n8693 OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange</a>) and that the request has already passed\nthe following validation steps.\n\n\n1. Confirm that the value of the `requested_token_type` request parameter\nis one of the registered token type identifiers if the request parameter is\ngiven and its value is not empty.\n2. Confirm that the `subject_token` request parameter is given and its\nvalue is not empty.\n3. Confirm that the `subject_token_type` request parameter is given and\nits value is one of the registered token type identifiers.\n4. Confirm that the `actor_token_type` request parameter is given and\nits value is one of the registered token type identifiers if the\n`actor_token` request parameter is given and its value is not empty.\n5. Confirm that the `actor_token_type` request parameter is not given\nor its value is empty when the `actor_token` request parameter is\nnot given or its value is empty.\n\n\nFurthermore, Authlete performs additional validation on the tokens specified\nby the `subject_token` request parameter and the `actor_token`\nrequest parameter according to their respective token types as shown below.\n\n**Token Validation Steps**\n\n*Token Type: `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt`*\n\n1. Confirm that the format conforms to the JWT specification [RFC 7519][https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html].\n2. Check if the JWT is encrypted and if it is encrypted, then (a) reject\n        the token exchange request when the {@link\n        Service#isTokenExchangeEncryptedJwtRejected()\n        tokenExchangeEncryptedJwtRejected} flag of the service is `true`\n        or (b) skip remaining validation steps when the flag is `false`.\n        Note that Authlete does not verify an encrypted JWT because there is\n        no standard way to obtain the key to decrypt the JWT with. This means\n        that you must verify an encrypted JWT by yourself when one is used as\n        an input token with the token type\n        { @code \"urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt\" }.\n3. Confirm that the current time has not reached the time indicated by\n        the `exp` claim if the JWT contains the claim.\n4. Confirm that the current time is equal to or after the time indicated\n        by the `iat` claim if the JWT contains the claim.\n5.Confirm that the current time is equal to or after the time indicated\n        by the `nbf` claim if the JWT contains the claim.\n6. Check if the JWT is signed and if it is not signed, then (a) reject\n        the token exchange request when the {@link\n        Service#isTokenExchangeUnsignedJwtRejected()\n        tokenExchangeUnsignedJwtRejected} flag of the service is `true`\n        or (b) finish validation on the input token. Note that Authlete does\n        not verify the signature of the JWT because there is no standard way\n        to obtain the key to verify the signature of a JWT with. This means\n        that you must verify the signature by yourself when a signed JWT is\n        used as an input token with the token type\n        `\"urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt\"`.\n\n*Token Type: `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token`*\n\n1. Confirm that the token is an access token that has been issued by\n        the Authlete server of your service. This implies that access\n        tokens issued by other systems cannot be used as a subject token\n        or an actor token with the token type\n        <code>urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token</code>.\n2. Confirm that the access token has not expired.\n3. Confirm that the access token belongs to the service.\n\n*Token Type: `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:refresh_token`*\n\n1. Confirm that the token is a refresh token that has been issued by\n        the Authlete server of your service. This implies that refresh\n        tokens issued by other systems cannot be used as a subject token\n        or an actor token with the token type\n        <code>urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:refresh_token</code>.\n2. Confirm that the refresh token has not expired.\n3. Confirm that the refresh token belongs to the service.\n\n*Token Type: `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token`*\n\n1. Confirm that the format conforms to the JWT specification (<a href=\n        \"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html\">RFC 7519</a>).\n2. Check if the ID Token is encrypted and if it is encrypted, then (a)\n        reject the token exchange request when the {@link\n        Service#isTokenExchangeEncryptedJwtRejected()\n        tokenExchangeEncryptedJwtRejected} flag of the service is `true`\n        or (b) skip remaining validation steps when the flag is `false`.\n        Note that Authlete does not verify an encrypted ID Token because\n        there is no standard way to obtain the key to decrypt the ID Token\n        with in the context of token exchange where the client ID for the\n        encrypted ID Token cannot be determined. This means that you must\n        verify an encrypted ID Token by yourself when one is used as an\n        input token with the token type\n        `\"urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token\"`.\n3. Confirm that the ID Token contains the `exp` claim and the\n        current time has not reached the time indicated by the claim.\n4. Confirm that the ID Token contains the `iat` claim and the\n        current time is equal to or after the time indicated by the claim.\n5. Confirm that the current time is equal to or after the time indicated\n        by the `nbf` claim if the ID Token contains the claim.\n6. Confirm that the ID Token contains the `iss` claim and the\n        value is a valid URI. In addition, confirm that the URI has the\n        `https` scheme, no query component and no fragment component.\n7. Confirm that the ID Token contains the `aud` claim and its\n        value is a JSON string or an array of JSON strings.\n8. Confirm that the value of the `nonce` claim is a JSON string\n        if the ID Token contains the claim.\n9. Check if the ID Token is signed and if it is not signed, then (a)\n        reject the token exchange request when the {@link\n        Service#isTokenExchangeUnsignedJwtRejected()\n        tokenExchangeUnsignedJwtRejected} flag of the service is `true`\n        or (b) finish validation on the input token.\n10. Confirm that the signature algorithm is asymmetric. This implies that\n        ID Tokens whose signature algorithm is symmetric (`HS256`,\n        `HS384` or `HS512`) cannot be used as a subject token or\n        an actor token with the token type\n        `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token`.\n11. Verify the signature of the ID Token. Signature verification is\n        performed even in the case where the issuer of the ID Token is not\n        your service. But in that case, the issuer must support the discovery\n        endpoint defined in <a href=\n        \"https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html\">OpenID\n        Connect Discovery 1.0</a>. Otherwise, signature verification fails.\n\n*Token Type: `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml1`*\n\n(Authlete does not perform any validation for this token type.)\n\n*Token Type: `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2`*\n\n(Authlete does not perform any validation for this token type.)\n\nThe specification of Token Exchange (<a href=\n\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693.html\">RFC 8693</a>) is very\nflexible. In other words, the specification has abandoned the task of\ndetermining details. Therefore, for secure token exchange, you have\nto complement the specification with your own rules. For that purpose,\nAuthlete provides some configuration options as listed below.\nAuthorization server implementers may utilize them and/or implement\ntheir own rules.\n\n\nIn the case of {@link Action#TOKEN_EXCHANGE TOKEN_EXCHANGE}, the {@link\n#getResponseContent()} method returns `null`. You have to construct\nthe token response by yourself.\n\nFor example, you may generate an access token by calling Authlete's\n`/api/auth/token/create` API and construct a token response like\nbelow.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: {challenge}\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store\n{\n    \"access_token\": \"{@link TokenCreateResponse#getAccessToken()}\",\n    \"issued_token_type\": \"urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token\",\n    \"token_type\": \"Bearer\",\n    \"expires_in\": { @link TokenCreateResponse#getExpiresIn() },\n    \"scope\": \"String.join(\" \", {@link TokenCreateResponse#getScopes()})\"\n}\n```\n\n\n**JWT_BEARER JWT_BEARER (Authlete 2.3 onwards)**\n\nWhen the value of `\"action\"` is `\"JWT_BEARER\"`, it means that\nthe request from the client application is a valid token request with the\ngrant type `\"urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer\"` (<a href=\n\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523.html\">RFC 7523 JSON Web Token (JWT)\nProfile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants</a>)\nand that the request has already passed the following validation steps.\n\n1. Confirm that the `assertion` request parameter is given and its value\n  is not empty.\n2. Confirm that the format of the assertion conforms to the JWT specification\n  (<a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html\">RFC 7519</a>).\n\n3. Check if the JWT is encrypted and if it is encrypted, then (a) reject the\n  token request when the {@link Service#isJwtGrantEncryptedJwtRejected()\n  jwtGrantEncryptedJwtRejected} flag of the service is `true` or (b)\n  skip remaining validation steps when the flag is `false`. Note that\n  Authlete does not verify an encrypted JWT because there is no standard way\n  to obtain the key to decrypt the JWT with. This means that you must verify\n  an encrypted JWT by yourself.\n4. Confirm that the JWT contains the `iss` claim and its value is a\n  JSON string.\n5. Confirm that the JWT contains the `sub` claim and its value is a\n  JSON string.\n6. Confirm that the JWT contains the `aud` claim and its value is\n  either a JSON string or an array of JSON strings.\n7. Confirm that the issuer identifier of the service (cf. {@link Service#getIssuer()})\n  or the URL of the token endpoint (cf. {@link Service#getTokenEndpoint()})\n  is listed as audience in the `aud` claim.\n8. Confirm that the JWT contains the `exp` claim and the current time\n  has not reached the time indicated by the claim.\n9.

Confirm that the current time is equal to or after the time indicated by\n  by the `nbf` claim if the JWT contains the claim.\n11. Check if the JWT is signed and if it is not signed, then (a) reject the\n  token request when the {@link Service#isJwtGrantUnsignedJwtRejected()\n  jwtGrantUnsignedJwtRejected} flag of the service is `true` or (b)\n  finish validation on the JWT. Note that Authlete does not verify the\n  signature of the JWT because there is no standard way to obtain the key\n  to verify the signature of a JWT with.

See\nthe description for the case of `action=PASSWORD`.\n\nThe response from `/auth/token/fail` API has some parameters.

According to the value of `action`, the\nauthorization server implementation must take the steps described below.\n\n**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization\nserver implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.\n\nIn either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.\nTherefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with\nHTTP status of \"500 Internal Server Error\".\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used\nas the entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\nThe endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client application\nsince \"500 Internal Server Error\" is not required by OAuth 2.0.\n\n**BAD_REQUEST**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that Authlete's `/auth/token/fail` API successfully\ngenerated an error response for the client application.\n\nThe HTTP status of the response returned to the client application must be \"400 Bad Request\" and\nthe content type must be `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used\nas the entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n</details>\n",

See\nthe description for the case of `action=PASSWORD`.\n\nThe response from `/auth/token/issue` API has some parameters. Among them, it is `action` parameter\nthat the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the next action\nthat the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of `action`, the\nauthorization server implementation must take the steps described below.\n\n**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization\nserver implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.\n\nIn either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.\nTherefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with\nHTTP status of \"500 Internal Server Error\".\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used\nas the entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\nThe endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client application\nsince \"500 Internal Server Error\" is not required by OAuth 2.0.\n\n**OK**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `OK`, it means that Authlete's `/auth/token/issue` API successfully\ngenerated an access token.\n\nThe HTTP status of the response returned to the client application must be \"200 OK\" and the content\ntype must be`application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which contains an access token, so it can be used\nas the entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation must generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n</details>\n",

        "description": "This API gathers information about an access token.\n\n<br>\n<details>\n<summary>Description</summary>\n\nThis API is supposed to be called from within the implementations of protected resource endpoints\nof the authorization server implementation in order to get information about the access token which\nwas presented by the client application.\n\nIn general, a client application accesses a protected resource endpoint of a service with an access\ntoken, and the implementation of the endpoint checks whether the presented access token has enough\nprivileges (= scopes) to access the protected resource before returning the protected resource to\nthe client application. To achieve this flow, the endpoint implementation has to know detailed\ninformation about the access token. Authlete `/auth/introspection` API can be used to get such information.\n\nThe response from `/auth/introspection` API has some parameters. Among them, it is `action` parameter\nthat the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the next action\nthat the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of `action`, the\nauthorization server implementation must take the steps described below.\n\n**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization\nserver implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.\nIn either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.\nTherefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with\nHTTP status of \"500 Internal Server Error\". Authlete recommends `application/json` as the content\ntype although OAuth 2.0 specification does not mention the format of the error response when the\nredirect URI is not usable.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of\n[RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if\nthe protected resource of the service implementation wants to return an error response to the client\napplication in the way that complies with RFC 6750 (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration\nparameter of the service is Bearer), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of\n`WWW-Authenticate` header.\n\nThe following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n**BAD_REQUEST**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application\ndoes not contain an access token (= the request from the authorization server implementation to\nAuthlete does not contain `token` request parameter).\n\nA response with HTTP status of \"400 Bad Request\" must be returned to the client application and\nthe content type must be `application/json`.\n\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC\n6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the\nprotected resource of the service implementation wants to return an error response to the client\napplication in the way that complies with RFC 6750 (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration\nparameter of the service is `Bearer`), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of\n`WWW-Authenticate` header.\n\nThe following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nWWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n```\n\n**UNAUTHORIZED**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that the access token does not exist or has\nexpired.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of RFC\n6750 (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the protected resource of the service implementation\nwants to return an error response to the client application in the way that complies with [RFC\n6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration\nparameter of the service is `Bearer`), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of\n`WWW-Authenticate` header.\n\nThe following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n```\n\n**FORBIDDEN**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `FORBIDDEN`, it means that the access token does not cover the required\nscopes or that the subject associated with the access token is different from the subject contained\nin the request.\n\nA response with HTTP status of \"400 Bad Request\" must be returned to the client application and\nthe content type must be `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC\n6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the\nprotected resource of the service implementation wants to return an error response to the client\napplication in the way that complies with RFC 6750 (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration\nparameter of the service is Bearer), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of\n`WWW-Authenticate` header.\n\nThe following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\nWWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n```\n\n**OK**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `OK`, it means that the access token which the client application\npresented is valid (= exists and has not expired).\n\nThe implementation of the protected resource endpoint is supposed to return the protected resource\nto the client application.\n\nWhen action is `OK`, the value of `responseContent` is `\"Bearer error=\\\"invalid_request\\\"\"`. This\nis the simplest string which can be used as the value of `WWW-Authenticate` header to indicate\n\"400 Bad Request\". The implementation of the protected resource endpoint may use this string to\ntell the client application that the request was bad (e.g. in case necessary request parameters\nfor the protected resource endpoint are missing). However, in such a case, the implementation\nshould generate a more informative error message to help developers of client applications.\n\nThe following is an example error response which complies with RFC 6750.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nWWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n```\n\nBasically, The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of\n[RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage). So, if\nthe service has selected `Bearer` as the value of `accessTokenType` configuration parameter, the\nvalue of `responseContent` can be used directly as the value of `WWW-Authenticate` header. However,\nif the service has selected another different token type, the service has to generate error messages\nfor itself.\n\n_**JWT-based access token**_\n\nSince version 2.1, Authlete provides a feature to issue access tokens in JWT format. This feature\ncan be enabled by setting a non-null value to the `accessTokenSignAlg` property of the service\n(see the description of the Service class for details). `/api/auth/introspection` API can accept\naccess tokens in JWT format. However, note that the API does not return information contained in\na given JWT-based access token but returns information stored in the database record which corresponds\nto the given JWT-based access token. Because attributes of the database record can be modified\nafter the access token is issued (for example, by using `/api/auth/token/update` API), information\nreturned by `/api/auth/introspection` API and information the given JWT-based access token holds\nmay be different.\n\n</details>\n",

The authorization server implementation should retrieve the value of `action` from\nthe response and take the following steps according to the value.\n\nIn general, a client application accesses a protected resource endpoint of a service with an access\ntoken, and the implementation of the endpoint checks whether the presented access token has enough\nprivileges (= scopes) to access the protected resource before returning the protected resource to\nthe client application. To achieve this flow, the endpoint implementation has to know detailed\ninformation about the access token. Authlete `/auth/introspection` API can be used to get such information.\n\nThe response from `/auth/introspection` API has some parameters. Among them, it is `action` parameter\nthat the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the next action\nthat the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of `action`, the\nauthorization server implementation must take the steps described below.\n\n**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization\nserver implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.\n\nIn either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.\nTherefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with\nHTTP status of \"500 Internal Server Error\".\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used\nas the entity body of the response if you want. Note that, however, [RFC 7662](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662) does not mention anything about the response\nbody of error responses.\n\nThe following illustrates an example response which the introspection endpoint of the authorization\nserver implementation generates and returns to the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n**BAD_REQUEST**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application\nis invalid. This happens when the request from the client did not include the token request parameter.\nSee \"[2.1. Introspection Request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662#section-2.1)\" in\nRFC 7662 for details about requirements for introspection requests.\n\nThe HTTP status of the response returned to the client application should be \"400 Bad Request\".\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used\nas the entity body of the response if you want. Note that, however, [RFC 7662](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662)\ndoes not mention anything about the response body of error responses.\n\nThe following illustrates an example response which the introspection endpoint of the authorization\nserver implementation generates and returns to the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n**OK**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `OK`, the request from the client application is valid.\n\nThe HTTP status of the response returned to the client application must be \"200 OK\" and its content\ntype must be `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which complies with the introspection response\ndefined in \"2.2. Introspection Response\" in RFC7662.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the introspection endpoint of your authorization server\nimplementation should generate and return to the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\nNote that RFC 7662 says _\"To prevent token scanning attacks, **the endpoint MUST also require some\nform of authorization to access this endpoint**\"_. This means that you have to protect your introspection\nendpoint in some way or other. Authlete does not care about how your introspection endpoint is protected.\nIn most cases, as mentioned in RFC 7662, \"401 Unauthorized\" is a proper response when an introspection\nrequest does not satisfy authorization requirements imposed by your introspection endpoint.\n\n</details>\n",

        "description": "This API gathers information about a user.\n\n<br>\n<details>\n<summary>Description</summary>\n\nThis API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the [userinfo endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo)\nof the authorization server in order to get information about the user that is associated with\nan access token.\n\nThe response from `/auth/userinfo` API has various parameters. Among them, it is `action` parameter\nthat the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the next action\nthat the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of `action`, the\nservice implementation must take the steps described below.\n\n**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization\nserver implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete. In either case, from the\nviewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side. Therefore, the service\nimplementation should generate a response to the client application with HTTP status of \"500 Internal\nServer Error\".\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750)\n(OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent`\nas the value of`WWW-Authenticate` header.\n\nThe following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core\n1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo\nResponse](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\nWWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n```\n\n**BAD_REQUEST**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application\ndoes not contain an access token (= the request from the authorization server implementation to\nAuthlete does not contain `token` parameter).\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format\nof [RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the\nuserinfo endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`\nheader.\n\nThe following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core\n1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo\nResponse](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nWWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n```\n\n**UNAUTHORIZED**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that the access token does not exist, has\nexpired, or is not associated with any subject (= any user account).\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC\n6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo\nendpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`\nheader.\n\nThe following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core\n1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo\nResponse](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n```\n\n**FORBIDDEN**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `FORBIDDEN`, it means that the access token does not include the\n`openid` scope.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750)\n(OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent`\nas the value of`WWW-Authenticate` header.\n\nThe following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core\n1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3.

To be concrete, it means that the access token exists, has not expired, includes\nthe openid scope, and is associated with a subject (= a user account).\n\nWhat the userinfo endpoint implementation should do next is to collect information about the subject\n(user) from your database. The value of the `subject` is contained in the subject parameter in the\nresponse from this API and the names of data, i.e., the claims names are contained in the claims\nparameter in the response. For example, if the `subject` parameter is `joe123` and the claims\nparameter is `[ \"given_name\", \"email\" ]`, you need to extract information about joe123's given name\nand email from your database.\n\nThen, call Authlete's `/auth/userinfo/issue` API with the collected information and the access token\nin order to make Authlete generate an ID token.\n\nIf an error occurred during the above steps, generate an error response to the client. The response\nshould comply with [RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750). For example, if the\nsubject associated with the access token does not exist in your database any longer, you may feel\nlike generating a response like below.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nWWW-Authenticate: Bearer error=\"invalid_token\",\n error_description=\"The subject associated with the access token does not exist.\"\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n```\n\nAlso, an error might occur on database access. If you treat the error as an internal server error,\nthen the response would be like the following.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\nWWW-Authenticate: Bearer error=\"server_error\",\n error_description=\"Failed to extract information about the subject from the database.\"\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n```\n</details>\n",

Before calling this API, a valid\nresponse from `/auth/userinfo` API must be obtained. Then, call this API with the access token\ncontained in the response and the claims values of the user (subject) associated with the access\ntoken. See **OK** written in the description of `/auth/userinfo` API for details.\n\nThe response from `/auth/userinfo/issue` API has various parameters. Among them, it is `action`\nparameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the\nnext action that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of\n`action`, the service implementation must take the steps described below.\n\n**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization\nserver implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete. In either case, from the\nviewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side. Therefore, the service\nimplementation should generate a response to the client application with HTTP status of \"500 Internal\nServer Error\".\n\nThe parameter `responseContent` returns a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC\n6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo\nendpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`\nheader.\n\nThe following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.

The authorization server implementation should retrieve\nthe value of `action` from the response and take the following steps according to the value.\n\n**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the API call from the authorization\nserver implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.\n\nIn either case, from a viewpoint of the client or developer, it is an error on the server side.\nTherefore, the authorization server implementation should generate a response with \"500 Internal\nServer Error\"s and `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as\nthe entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate\nand return to the client or developer.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\nThe endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client or developer since\n\"500 Internal Server Error\" is not required by the specification.\n\n**BAD_REQUEST**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client or developer\nwas wrong.\n\nThe authorization server implementation should generate a response with \"400 Bad Request\" and `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used\nas the entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate\nand return to the client or developer.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n**CREATED**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `CREATED`, it means that the request from the client or developer is\nvalid.\n\nThe authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client or developer with\n\"201 CREATED\" and `application/json`.\n\nThe `responseContent` a JSON string which can be used as the entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate\nand return to the client or developer.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 201 CREATED\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n</details>\n",

The authorization server implementation should\nretrieve the value of `action` from the response and take the following steps according to the value.\n\n**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the API call from the authorization\nserver implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.\n\nIn either case, from a viewpoint of the client or developer, it is an error on the server side.\nTherefore, the authorization server implementation should generate a response with \"500 Internal\nServer Error\"s and `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as\nthe entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate\nand return to the client or developer.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\nThe endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client or developer since\n\"500 Internal Server Error\" is not required by the specification.\n\n**BAD_REQUEST**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client or developer\nwas wrong.\n\nThe authorization server implementation should generate a response with \"400 Bad Request\" and `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as\nthe entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate\nand return to the client or developer.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n**UNAUTHORIZED**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that the registration access token used by\nthe client configuration request (RFC 7592) is invalid, or the client application which the token\nis tied to does not exist any longer or is invalid.\n\nThe HTTP status of the response returned to the client application must be \"401 Unauthorized\" and\nthe content type must be `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as\nthe entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the endpoint implementation should generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\nNOTE: The `UNAUTHORIZED` value was added in October, 2021. See the description of\n`Service.unauthorizedOnClientConfigSupported` for details.\n\n**DELETED**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `DELETED`, it means that the request from the client or developer is\nvalid.\n\nThe authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client or developer with\n\"204 No Content\".\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate\nand return to the client or developer.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 204 No Content\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n```\n</details>\n",

The endpoint implementation must extract the request parameters from the\nbackchannel authentication request from the client application and pass them as the value of parameters\nrequest parameter for Authlete's `/backchannel/authentication` API.\n\nThe value of parameters is the entire entity body (which is formatted in `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`)\nof the request from the client application.\n\nThe following code snippet is an example in JAX-RS showing how to extract request parameters from\nthe backchannel authentication request.\n\n```java\n@POST\n@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED)\npublic Response post(String parameters)\n{\n    // 'parameters' is the entity body of the backchannel authentication request.\n    ......\n}\n```\n\nThe endpoint implementation does not have to parse the request parameters from the client application\nbecause Authlete's `/backchannel/authentication` API does it.\n\nThe response from `/backchannel/authentication` API has various parameters. Among them, it is `action`\nparameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the\nnext action that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of\n`action`, the service implementation must take the steps described below.\n\n**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization\nserver implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.\nIn either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.\nTherefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with\nHTTP status of \"500 Internal Server Error\" and `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used\nas the entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n**BAD_REQUEST**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application\nis invalid.\n\nThe authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client application with\n\"400 Bad Request\" and `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as\nthe entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n**UNAUTHORIZED**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that client authentication of the backchannel\nauthentication request failed. Note that client authentication is always required at the backchannel\nauthentication endpoint. This implies that public clients are not allowed to use the backchannel\nauthentication endpoint.\n\nThe authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client application with\n\"401 Unauthorized\" and `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as\nthe entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation must generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: (challenge)\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n**USER_IDENTIFICATION**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `USER_IDENTIFICATION`, it means that the backchannel authentication\nrequest from the client application is valid. The authorization server implementation has to follow\nthe steps below.\n\n[1] END-USER IDENTIFICATION\n\nThe first step is to determine the subject (= unique identifier) of the end-user from whom the\nclient application wants to get authorization.\n\nAccording to the CIBA specification, a backchannel authentication request contains one (and only\none) of the `login_hint_token`, `id_token_hint` and `login_hint` request parameters as a hint\nby which the authorization server identifies the subject of an end-user.<br>\nThe authorization server implementation can know which hint is included in the backchannel authentication\nrequest by the `hintType` parameter. For example, when the value of the parameter `LOGIN_HINT`,\nit means that the backchannel authentication request contains the `login_hint` request parameter\nas a hint.<br>\n\nThe value of the `hint` parameter is the value of the hint. For example, when the value of the\n`hintType` parameter is `LOGIN_HINT`, The value of the `hint` parameter is the value of the `login_hint`\nrequest parameter.<br>\n\nIt is up to the authorization server implementation how to determine the subject of the end-user\nfrom the hint. Only when the `id_token_hint` request parameter is used, authorization server\nimplementation can use the sub response parameter, which holds the value of the sub claim in the\n`id_token_hint` request parameter.\n\n[2] END-USER IDENTIFICATION ERROR\n\nThere are some cases where the authorization server implementation encounters an error during\nthe user identification process. In any error case, the service implementation has to return an\nHTTP response with the error response parameter to the client application. The following is an\nexample of such error responses.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{ \"error\":\"unknown_user_id\" }\n```\n\nAuthlete provides `/backchannel/authentication/fail` API that builds the response body (JSON)\nof an error response. However, because it is easy to build an error response manually, you may\nchoose not to call the API. One good thing in using the API is that the API call can trigger\ndeletion of the ticket which has been issued from Authlete's `/backchannel/authentication` API.\nIf you don't call `/backchannel/authentication/fail` API, the ticket will continue to exist in\nthe database until it is cleaned up by the batch program after the ticket expires.<br>\n\nPossible error cases that the authorization server implementation itself has to handle are as\nfollows. Other error cases have already been covered by `/backchannel/authentication` API.\n\n- <u>`expired_login_hint_token`</u><br>\n  The authorization server implementation detected that the hint presented by the `login_hint_token`\n  request parameter has expired.\n\n  Note that the format of `login_hint_token` is not described in the CIBA Core spec at all and\n  so there is no consensus on how to detect expiration of `login_hint_token`. Interpretation\n  of `login_hint_token` is left to each authorization server implementation.\n\n- <u>`unknown_user_id`</u><br>\n  The authorization server implementation could not determine the subject of the end-user by\n  the presented hint.\n\n- <u>`unauthorized_client`</u><br>\n  The authorization server implementation has custom rules to reject backchannel authentication\n  requests from some particular clients and found that the client which has made the backchannel\n  authentication request is one of the particular clients.\n\n  Note that `/backchannel/authentication` API does not return `action=USER_IDENTIFICATION` in\n  cases where the client does not exist or client authentication has failed. Therefore, the\n  authorization server implementation will never have to use the error code `unauthorized_client`\n  unless the server has intentionally implemented custom rules to reject backchannel authentication\n  requests based on clients.\n\n- <u>`missing_user_code`</u><br>\n  The authorization server implementation has custom rules to require that a backchannel authentication\n  request include a user code for some particular users and found that the user identified by\n  the hint is one of the particular users.\n\n  Note that `/backchannel/authentication` API does not return `action=USER_IDENTIFICATION` when\n  both the `backchannel_user_code_parameter_supported` metadata of the server and the\n  `backchannel_user_code_parameter` metadata of the client are true and the backchannel authentication\n  request does not include the user_code request parameter. In this case, `/backchannel/authentication`\n  API returns action=BAD_REQUEST with JSON containing `\"error\":\"missing_user_code\"`. Therefore,\n  the authorization server implementation will never have to use the error code `missing_user_code`\n  unless the server has intentionally implemented custom rules to require a user code based\n  on users even in the case where the `backchannel_user_code_parameter` metadata of the client\n  which has made the backchannel authentication request is `false`.\n\n- <u>`invalid_user_code`</u><br>\n  The authorization server implementation detected that the presented user code is invalid.\n\n  Note that the format of user_code is not described in the CIBA Core spec at all and so there\n  is no consensus on how to judge whether a user code is valid or not. It is up to each authorization\n  server implementation how to handle user codes.\n\n- <u>`invalid_binding_message`</u><br>\n  The authorization server implementation detected that the presented binding message is invalid.\n\n  Note that the format of binding_message is not described in the CIBA Core spec at all and\n  so there is no consensus on how to judge whether a binding message is valid or not. It is\n  up to each authorization server implementation how to handle binding messages.\n\n- <u>`invalid_target`</u><br>\n  The authorization server implementation rejects the requested target resources.\n\n  The error code invalid_target is from \"Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0\". The specification\n  defines the resource request parameter. By using the parameter, client applications can request\n  target resources that should be bound to the access token being issued. If the authorization\n  server wants to reject the request, call `/backchannel/authentication/fail` API with `INVALID_TARGET`.\n\n- <u>`access_denined`</u><br>\n  The authorization server implementation has custom rules to reject backchannel authentication\n  requests without asking the end-user and respond to the client as if the end-user had rejected\n  the request in some particular cases and found that the backchannel authentication request\n  is one of the particular cases.\n\n  The authorization server implementation will never have to use the error code `access_denied`\n  at this timing unless the server has intentionally implemented custom rules to reject backchannel\n  authentication requests without asking the end-user and respond to the client as if the end-user\n  had rejected the request.\n\n[3] AUTH_REQ_ID ISSUE\n\nIf the authorization server implementation has successfully determined the subject of the end-user,\nthe next action is to return an HTTP response to the client application which contains `auth_req_id`.\n\nAuthlete provides `/backchannel/authentication/issue` API which generates a JSON containing `auth_req_id`,\nso, your next action is (1) call the API, (2) receive the response from the API, (3) build a response\nto the client application using the content of the API response, and (4) return the response to\nthe client application. See the description of `/backchannel/authentication/issue` API for details.\n\n[4] END-USER AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION\n\nAfter sending a JSON containing `auth_req_id` back to the client application, the service implementation\nstarts to communicate with an authentication device of the end-user. It is assumed that end-user\nauthentication is performed on the authentication device and the end-user confirms the content of\nthe backchannel authentication request and grants authorization to the client application if everything\nis okay. The authorization server implementation must be able to receive the result of the end-user\nauthentication and authorization from the authentication device.\n\nHow to communicate with an authentication device and achieve end-user authentication and authorization\nis up to each authorization server implementation, but the following request parameters of the backchannel\nauthentication request should be taken into consideration in any implementation.\n\n- <u>`acr_values`</u><br>\n  A backchannel authentication request may contain an array of ACRs (Authentication Context Class\n  References) in preference order. If multiple authentication devices are registered for the end-user,\n  the authorization server implementation should take the ACRs into consideration when selecting\n  the best authentication device.\n\n- <u>`scope`</u><br>\n  A backchannel authentication request always contains a list of scopes. At least, `openid` is\n  included in the list (otherwise `/backchannel/authentication` API returns `action=BAD_REQUEST`).\n  It would be better to show the requested scopes to the end-user on the authentication device\n  or somewhere appropriate.\n\n  If the scope request parameter contains `address`, `email`, `phone` and/or `profile`, they are\n  interpreted as defined in \"5.4. Requesting Claims using Scope Values of OpenID Connect Core 1.0\".\n  That is, they are expanded into a list of claim names. The claimNames parameter returns the expanded\n  result.\n\n- <u>`binding_message`</u><br>\n  A backchannel authentication request may contain a binding message. It is a human readable identifier\n  or message intended to be displayed on both the consumption device (client application) and the\n  authentication device.\n\n- <u>`user_code`</u><br>\n  A backchannel authentication request may contain a user code. It is a secret code, such as password\n  or pin, known only to the end-user but verifiable by the authorization server. The user code should\n  be used to authorize sending a request to the authentication device.\n\n[5] END-USER AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION COMPLETION\n\nAfter receiving the result of end-user authentication and authorization, the authorization server\nimplementation must call Authlete's `/backchannel/authentication/complete` API to tell Authlete\nthe result and pass necessary data so that Authlete can generate an ID token, an access token and\noptionally a refresh token. See the description of the API for details.\n\n[6] CLIENT NOTIFICATION\n\nWhen the backchannel token delivery mode is either `ping` or `push`, the authorization server implementation\nmust send a notification to the pre-registered notification endpoint of the client after the end-user\nauthentication and authorization. In this case, the `action` parameter in a response from `/backchannel/authentication/complete`\nAPI is `NOTIFICATION`. See the description of `/backchannel/authentication/complete` API for details.\n\n[7] TOKEN REQUEST\n\nWhen the backchannel token delivery mode is either `ping` or `poll`, the client application will make\na token request to the token endpoint to get an ID token, an access token and optionally a refresh\ntoken.\n\nA token request that corresponds to a backchannel authentication request uses `urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba`\nas the value of the `grant_type` request parameter. Authlete's `/auth/token` API recognizes the\ngrant type automatically and behaves properly, so the existing token endpoint implementation does\nnot have to be changed to support CIBA.\n</details>\n",

The JSON should be used as the response body\nof the response which is returned to the client from the [backchannel authentication endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#auth_backchannel_endpoint)\n\n<br>\n<details>\n<summary>Description</summary>\n\nThis API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the backchannel authentication\nendpoint of the service in order to generate a successful response to the client application.\n\nThe description of the `/backchannel/authentication` API describes the timing when this API should\nbe called and the meaning of request parameters. See [AUTH_REQ_ID ISSUE] in `USER_IDENTIFICATION`.\n\nThe response from `/backchannel/authentication/issue` API has some parameters. Among them, it is\n`action` parameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes\nthe next `action` that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value\nof `action`, the authorization server implementation must take the steps described below.\n\n```java\n@POST\n@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED)\npublic Response post(String parameters)\n{\n    // 'parameters' is the entity body of the backchannel authentication request.\n    ......\n}\n```\n\nThe endpoint implementation does not have to parse the request parameters from the client application\nbecause Authlete's `/backchannel/authentication` API does it.\n\nThe response from `/backchannel/authentication` API has various parameters. Among them, it is `action`\nparameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the\nnext action that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of\n`action`, the service implementation must take the steps described below.\n\n**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization\nserver implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.\nIn either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.\nTherefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with\nHTTP status of \"500 Internal Server Error\" and `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as\nthe entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n**INVALID_TICKET**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INVALID_TICKET`, it means that the ticket included in the API call\nwas invalid. For example, it does not exist or has expired.\n\nFrom a viewpoint of the client application, this is an error on the server side. Therefore, the\nauthorization server implementation should generate a response to the client application with\n\"500 Internal Server Error\" and `application/json`.\n\nYou can build an error response in the same way as shown in the description for the case of `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`.\n\n**OK**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `OK`, it means that Authlete has succeeded in preparing JSON that\ncontains an `auth_req_id`. The JSON should be used as the response body of the response that is\nreturned to the client from the backchannel authentication endpoint. `responseContent` contains\nthe JSON.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate\nand return to the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n</details>\n",

        "description": "This API returns information about what action the authorization server should take after it receives\nthe result of end-user's decision about whether the end-user has approved or rejected a client application's\nrequest on the authentication device.\n\n<br>\n<details>\n<summary>Description</summary>\n\nAfter the implementation of the backchannel authentication endpoint returns JSON containing an\n`auth_req_id` to the client, the authorization server starts a background process that communicates\nwith the authentication device of the end-user. On the authentication device, end-user authentication\nis performed and the end-user is asked whether they give authorization to the client or not. The\nauthorization server will receive the result of end-user authentication and authorization from\nthe authentication device.\n\nAfter the authorization server receives the result from the authentication device, or even in the\ncase where the server gave up receiving a response from the authentication device for some reasons,\nthe server should call the `/backchannel/authentication/complete` API to tell Authlete the result.\n\nWhen the end-user was authenticated and authorization was granted to the client by the end-user,\nthe authorization server should call the API with `result=AUTHORIZED`. In this successful case,\nthe `subject` request parameter is mandatory. If the token delivery mode is `push`, the API will generate\nan access token, an ID token and optionally a refresh token. On the other hand, if the token delivery\nmode is `poll` or `ping`, the API will just update the database record so that `/auth/token` API\ncan generate tokens later.\n\nWhen the authorization server received the decision of the end-user from the authentication device\nand it indicates that the end-user has rejected to give authorization to the client, the authorization\nserver should call the API with `result=ACCESS_DENIED`. In this case, if the token delivery mode\nis `push`, the API will generate an error response that contains the error response parameter and\noptionally the `error_description` and error_uri response parameters (if the `errorDescription`\nand `errorUri` request parameters have been given). On the other hand, if the token delivery mode\nis `poll` or `ping`, the API will just update the database record so that `/auth/token` API can\ngenerate an error response later. In any token delivery mode, the value of the error parameter will\nbecome `access_denied`.\n\nWhen the authorization server could not get the result of end-user authentication and authorization\nfrom the authentication device for some reasons, the authorization server should call the API with\n`result=TRANSACTION_FAILED`. In this error case, the API will behave in the same way as in the case\nof `ACCESS_DENIED`. The only difference is that `expired_token` is used as the value of the `error`\nparameter.\n\nThe response from `/backchannel/authentication/complete` API has various parameters. Among them,\nit is `action` parameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because\nit denotes the next action that the authorization server implementation should take. According to\nthe value of `action`, the service implementation must take the steps described below.\n\n**SERVER_ERROR**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `SERVER_ERROR`, it means either (1) that the request from the authorization\nserver to Authlete was wrong, or (2) that an error occurred on Authlete side.\n\nWhen the backchannel token delivery mode is `ping` or `push`, `SERVER_ERROR` is used only when\nan error is detected before the record of the ticket (which is included in the API call to `/backchannel/authentication/complete`)\nis retrieved from the database successfully. If an error is detected after the record of the ticket\nis retrieved from the database, `NOTIFICATION` is used instead of `SERVER_ERROR`.\n\nWhen the backchannel token delivery mode is `poll`, `SERVER_ERROR` is used regardless of whether\nit is before or after the record of the ticket is retrieved from the database.\n\n**NO_ACTION**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `NO_ACTION`, it means that the authorization server does not have\nto take any immediate action.\n\n`NO_ACTION` is returned when the backchannel token delivery mode is `poll`. In this case, the client\nwill receive the final result at the token endpoint.\n\n**NOTIFICATION**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `NOTIFICATION`, it means that the authorization server must send a\nnotification to the client notification endpoint.\n\nAccording to the CIBA Core specification, the notification is an HTTP POST request whose request\nbody is JSON and whose `Authorization` header contains the client notification token, which was\nincluded in the backchannel authentication request as the value of the `client_notification_token`\nrequest parameter, as a bearer token.\n\nWhen the backchannel token delivery mode is `ping`, the request body of the notification is JSON\nwhich contains the `auth_req_id` property only. When the backchannel token delivery mode is `push`,\nthe request body will additionally contain an access token, an ID token and other properties. Note\nthat when the backchannel token delivery mode is `poll`, a notification does not have to be sent\nto the client notification endpoint.\n\nIn error cases, in the ping mode, however, the content of a notification is not different from the\ncontent in successful cases. That is, the notification contains the `auth_req_id` property only.\nThe client will know the error when it accesses the token endpoint. On the other hand, in the\n`push` mode, in error cases, the content of a notification will include the `error` property instead\nof an access token and an ID token. The client will know the error by detecting that error is included\nin the notification.\n\nIn any case, the value of `responseContent` is JSON which can be used as the request body of the\nnotification.\n\nThe client notification endpoint that the notification should be sent to the value of the `clientNotificationEndpoint`\nparameter. Likewise, the client notification token that the notification should include as a bearer\ntoken is the `clientNotificationToken` parameter. With these methods, the notification can be built\nlike the following.\n\n```\nPOST {clientNotificationEndpoint} HTTP/1.1\nHOST: {The host of clientNotificationEndpoint}\nAuthorization: Bearer {notificationToken}\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n</details>\n",

The service implementation should retrieve the value of `action` from the\nresponse and take the following steps according to the value.\n\n**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the API call from the authorization\nserver implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.\n\nIn either case, from a viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.\nTherefore, the authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client application\nwith \"500 Internal Server Error\"s and `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes t he error, so it can be\nused as the entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate\nand return to the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n**BAD_REQUEST**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application\nis wrong.\n\nThe authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client application with\n\"400 Bad Request\" and `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as\nthe entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n**UNAUTHORIZED**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that client authentication of the device authorization\nrequest failed.\n\nThe authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client application with\n\"401 Unauthorized\" and `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as\nthe entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation must generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: (challenge)\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n**OK**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `OK`, it means that the device authorization request from the client\napplication is valid.\n\nThe authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client application with\n\"200 OK\" and `application/json`.\n\nThe `responseContent` is a JSON string which can be used as the entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate\nand return to the client application.\n</details>\n",

Then, the end-user will access the verification URI using\na web browser on another device (typically, a smart phone). In normal implementations, the verification\nendpoint will return an HTML page with an input form where the end-user inputs a user code. The\nauthorization server will receive a user code from the form.\n\nAfter receiving a user code, the authorization server should call Authlete's `/device/verification`\nAPI with the user code. And then, the authorization server implementation should retrieve the value\nof `action` parameter from the API response and take the following steps according to the value.\n\n**SERVER_ERROR**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `SERVER_ERROR`, it means that an error occurred on Authlete side. The\nauthorization server implementation should tell the end-user that something wrong happened and\nurge her to re-initiate a device flow.\n\n**NOT_EXIST**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `NOT_EXIST`, it means that the user code does not exist. The authorization\nserver implementation should tell the end-user that the user code is invalid and urge her to retry\nto input a valid user code.\n\n**EXPIRED**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `EXPIRED`, it means that the user code has expired. The authorization\nserver implementation should tell the end-user that the user code has expired and urge her to\nre-initiate a device flow.\n\n**VALID**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `VALID`, it means that the user code exists, has not expired, and\nbelongs to the service. The authorization server implementation should interact with the end-user\nto ask whether she approves or rejects the authorization request from the device.\n</details>\n",

The verification endpoint checks\nif the user code is valid and then asks the end-user whether she approves or rejects the authorization\nrequest which the user code represents.\n\nAfter the authorization server receives the decision of the end-user, it should call Authlete's\n`/device/complete` API to tell Authlete the decision.\n\nWhen the end-user was authenticated and authorization was granted to the client by the end-user,\nthe authorization server should call the API with `result=AUTHORIZED`. In this successful case,\nthe subject request parameter is mandatory. The API will update the database record so that `/auth/token`\nAPI can generate an access token later.\n\nIf the `scope` parameter of the device authorization request included the openid scope, an ID token\nis generated. In this case, `sub`, `authTime`, `acr` and `claims` request parameters in the API\ncall to `/device/complete` affect the ID token.\n\nWhen the authorization server receives the decision of the end-user and it indicates that she has\nrejected to give authorization to the client, the authorization server should call the API with\n`result=ACCESS_DENIED`. In this case, the API will update the database record so that the `/auth/token`\nAPI can generate an error response later. If `errorDescription` and `errorUri` request parameters\nare given to the `/device/complete` API, they will be used as the values of `error_description`\nand `error_uri` response parameters in the error response from the token endpoint.\n\nWhen the authorization server could not get decision from the end-user for some reasons, the authorization\nserver should call the API with `result=TRANSACTION_FAILED`. In this error case, the API will behave\nin the same way as in the case of `ACCESS_DENIED`. The only difference is that `expired_token` is\nused as the value of the `error` response parameter instead of `access_denied`.\n\nAfter receiving a response from the `/device/complete` API, the implementation of the authorization\nserver should retrieve the value of `action` from the response and take the following steps according\nto the value.\n\n**SERVER_ERROR**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `SERVER_ERROR`, it means that an error occurred on Authlete side. The\nauthorization server implementation should tell the end-user that something wrong happened and\nurge her to re-initiate a device flow.\n\n**USER_CODE_NOT_EXIST**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `USER_CODE_NOT_EXIST`, it means that the user code included in the API\ncall does not exist. The authorization server implementation should tell the end-user that the user\ncode has been invalidated and urge her to re-initiate a device flow.\n\n**USER_CODE_EXPIRED**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `USER_CODE_EXPIRED`,  it means that the user code included in the API\ncall has expired. The authorization server implementation should tell the end-user that the user\ncode has expired and urge her to re-initiate a device flow.\n\n**INVALID_REQUEST**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INVALID_REQUEST`, it means that the API call is invalid. Probably,\nthe authorization server implementation has some bugs.\n\n**SUCCESS**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `SUCCESS`, it means that the API call has been processed successfully.\nThe authorization server should return a successful response to the web browser the end-user is\nusing.\n</details>\n",
